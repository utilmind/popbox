# popbox
Lightweight popup box. Requires jQuery, but can be easily rewritten without jQuery.

Live demo:

Originally developed for PBC: https://palmbeachcuisine.com/restaurant-specials.html

UPDATE 1.07.2019: added new feature-value for "auto_start_disabled" option: "scroll". So if "auto_start_disabled" = "scroll", the auto_show timer will be started only after any window.scroll event.
